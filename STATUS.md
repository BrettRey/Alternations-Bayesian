# STATUS.md - Alternations-Bayesian

## Project State
**Phase**: Initial planning
**Last updated**: 2026-01-14

## Goal
Bayesian model of English alternations (subordinator realization as initial test case), CGEL-compatible terminology, Gelman-style workflow.

## Related Projects
- `../Unsolved-problems-linguistics/` - this project tackles problem #1 from that survey

## Current Status
- Background materials saved from ChatGPT brainstorming session
- No code or manuscript yet

## Next Steps
1. Decide on corpus/data source for subordinator realization
2. Set up R/Stan infrastructure
3. Operationalize predictors (distance, weight, surprisal, register)
4. Build initial model

## Open Questions
- Which corpus? (ICE, BNC, Switchboard, combination?)
- How to compute surprisal? (GPT-2, custom LM?)
- Start with content clauses only, or include relatives from the start?

## Session Log

### 2026-01-14
- Project created
- Saved background materials from ChatGPT:
  - Unsolved problems survey (12 problems, solubility ranking)
  - Solution sketch (unified mechanism, predictions)
  - CGEL/Gelman model specification
