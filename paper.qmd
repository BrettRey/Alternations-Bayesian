## Abstract
TBD.

## Introduction
TBD.

## Data
TBD.

## Model
TBD.

## Bayesian workflow
We follow a Gelman-style Bayesian workflow: start with a generative story, fit a multilevel baseline, and iterate based on predictive checks. Concretely:

- Standardize predictors and use weakly informative priors.
- Run prior predictive checks for overall and by-register rates.
- Fit a baseline hierarchical model with partial pooling by lemma and register.
- Run posterior predictive checks targeted to the claims (overall, by register, by lemma).
- Validate out of sample by holding out whole documents or registers.
- Expand the model only when prediction or interpretation improves.

## Results
Baseline summary (first pass). The extracted dataset contains 302,522 content-clause tokens with an overall overt-*that* rate of 0.239. A baseline hierarchical logistic model (lemma + register varying intercepts; standardized clause length and head–clause distance) fit to a 20,000‑token sample yields a positive length effect (β_len ≈ 0.51) and a negative distance effect (β_dist ≈ −0.53). Estimated heterogeneity is substantial at the lemma level (σ_lemma ≈ 1.78) and smaller but nontrivial by register (σ_reg ≈ 0.99). Diagnostics for the baseline fit show no divergences; PPC summaries are in `results/`.

## Discussion
TBD.
