  When speakers produce a finite content clause, they face a choice: include
  the subordinator *that* or leave the clause bare. This paper argues that
  the probabilities governing this choice are part of grammatical knowledge --
  systematic, learnable from usage, and conditioned by lexical, register, and
  processing factors. Using 302,522 content-clause tokens from the Open
  American National Corpus and a Bayesian multilevel model with partial
  pooling over matrix verbs, I show that (i) different verbs have dramatically
  different *that* rates, (ii) spoken registers favour bare clauses while
  written registers favour overt *that*, and (iii) longer clauses favour
  *that*, consistent with processing accounts. Out-of-sample validation
  confirms that these patterns are predictive, not just descriptive. The
  analysis demonstrates both the substantive point -- that alternation
  probabilities are grammar -- and the methodological value of Bayesian
  multilevel modeling for linguistic questions.

## Introduction

Consider two ways of reporting the same belief:

a. *I think that she left early.*
b. *I think she left early.*

Both sentences are grammatical. Both mean the same thing. But they aren't
interchangeable: the choice between them isn't random, and native speakers have
reliable intuitions about which sounds more natural in particular contexts.

This variability poses a puzzle for grammatical theory. If both forms are
grammatical, what determines which one a speaker uses? Three answers present
themselves. First, the choice might be free variation -- random fluctuation
with no linguistic conditioning. Second, it might be performance noise --
errors or slips irrelevant to grammatical competence. Third, it might be
grammatical knowledge -- systematic patterns learned from usage and sensitive
to linguistic context.

This paper defends the third answer. I argue that the probabilities governing
subordinator realization are part of speakers' grammatical knowledge: they're
systematic, learnable, context-sensitive, and predictively robust. This claim
has broader implications. If correct, it suggests that grammar encodes
probabilistic knowledge, not just categorical rules. And it positions
alternations -- competition between grammatical variants -- as a central topic
for grammatical theory.

The argument proceeds as follows. Section 2 situates the analysis in the *CGEL*
framework and reviews prior literature on *that*-omission. Section 3 articulates
the theoretical claim that alternation probabilities are grammatical knowledge.
Section 4 provides a gentle introduction to Bayesian multilevel modeling for
linguists unfamiliar with the approach. Sections 5 and 6 describe the data and
model. Section 7 presents results, and Section 8 discusses their implications.

## Subordinator Realization in English

### The *CGEL* Framework

Following *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* [@HuddlestonPullum2002],
I use the term [subordinator]{.smallcaps} for the word *that* when it introduces
a finite content clause. *CGEL* distinguishes [*that*-content clauses]{.smallcaps}
(with an overt subordinator) from [bare content clauses]{.smallcaps} (without).
Both function as complements of verbs (*think*, *say*), adjectives (*sure*,
*aware*), and nouns (*fact*, *idea*).

This terminology contrasts with the generative tradition, which calls *that* a
"complementizer." The *CGEL* analysis treats *that* as a marker of declarative
clause type -- parallel to *if* and *whether* for interrogatives -- rather than
as a head that takes the clause as its complement. The terminological choice
reflects a substantive theoretical commitment, but the empirical patterns I
report don't depend on it.

*CGEL* notes that *that* is "often optional" in content clauses but doesn't
systematically characterize the conditioning factors. This is typical of
reference grammars: they describe what's possible, not what's probable. The
present analysis takes the next step, asking what determines the probability of
each variant.

### Functions of Content Clauses

Content clauses serve several grammatical functions, and the availability of the
*that* ~ bare alternation differs across them.

As [subjects]{.smallcaps}, content clauses strongly prefer overt *that*. Compare
*That she left surprised everyone* with the marginal *She left surprised
everyone*. The bare variant isn't ungrammatical in all analyses, but it's rare
in usage and often sounds odd. Subject content clauses don't exhibit the robust
variation we see elsewhere.

As [complements]{.smallcaps} of verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the alternation is
productive. Both *I think that she left* and *I think she left* are fully
acceptable, and the choice between them is conditioned by the factors discussed
below. This is where the action is.

In [extraposed]{.smallcaps} position, content clauses also show variation,
though the patterns differ from non-extraposed complements. *It's clear that
she left* and *It's clear she left* are both acceptable. In the present data,
extraposed adjective complements show the highest *that*-rate of any
construction (56%), while non-extraposed adjective complements run around 40%
and verb complements around 24%. The extraction captures extraposition by
detecting expletive *it* as subject of the matrix predicate, yielding about
25,000 extraposed tokens (8% of the total).

The present analysis focuses on complement content clauses (both in situ and extraposed) -- the position where variation is most productive. This follows the variationist principle of defining an [envelope of variation]{.smallcaps}: we study alternation only where both variants genuinely compete. Including subject clauses, where *that* is near-obligatory, would inflate the *that*-rate and obscure the conditioning factors that govern the choice in variable contexts.

This scoping decision isn't a limitation to be apologized for. It reflects the
fact that grammar has two components: categorical constraints (subjects require
*that*) and probabilistic preferences (complements vary). Both are grammatical
knowledge. The categorical constraints aren't in dispute. The probabilistic
preferences are less understood, and that's what we're investigating.

### Conditioning Factors from Prior Research

Research on *that*-omission has typically identified four main classes of conditioning factors.

First, **lexical identity** is perhaps the strongest predictor. Individual matrix verbs differ sharply in their subordinator preferences. Classic studies have long noted that high-frequency "cognitive" verbs like *think*, *know*, *guess*, and *say* strongly favour bare clauses, often appearing in formulae that function essentially as epistemic parentheticals [@ThompsonMulac1991; @Tagliamonte2006]. In contrast, more formal or factive verbs like *prove*, *demonstrate*, and *ensure* typically require or strongly favour overt *that* [@BiberEtAl1999]. This lexical specificity suggests that speakers learn verb-by-verb probabilistic patterns, a view consistent with constructionist approaches to argument structure [@Goldberg2006].

Second, **register** plays a major role. Quantitative corpus studies consistently find that spoken English uses bare clauses far more frequently than written English [@BiberEtAl1999]. Within written registers, informal genres (like fiction or personal letters) show higher rates of omission than academic prose or press reportage. These patterns likely reflect a combination of formality, planning time, and genre-specific conventions.

Third, **complexity** affects the choice. Under the *Complexity Principle* [@Rohdenburg1996], more explicit grammatical options (like overt *that*) are preferred in cognitively complex environments. Empirical work supports this: longer content clauses favour overt *that*, as do clauses separated from their matrix verb by intervening material. The subordinator is thought to function as a parsing cue, signalling a clause boundary and facilitating processing in difficult contexts [@BresnanFord2010].

Fourth, **information-theoretic** accounts invoke surprisal. The *Uniform Information Density* (UID) hypothesis predicts that speakers manage information flow by inserting optional function words when the onset of the embedded clause is unpredictable [@LevyJaeger2007; @Jaeger2010; @Levy2008]. If the content clause is highly predictable given the matrix verb (e.g., after *I think*), *that* is redundant and likely omitted. If the clause is unexpected, *that* is inserted to smooth the information profile.

Most prior work uses significance testing to identify these effects. A typical
finding is that some predictor shows a "significant effect" (*p* < .05), but
this framing has limitations. It tells us that an effect isn't zero, not how
large it is or how confident we should be. And it treats each predictor in
isolation, missing the interactions among lexical, register, and processing
factors.

## Alternation Probabilities as Grammatical Knowledge

I propose that the probability of choosing *that* over a bare clause isn't
performance noise or random variation. It's part of speakers' grammatical
competence -- knowledge they acquire from usage and carry with them as part of
knowing English.

This claim has three components. First, the patterns are [systematic]{.smallcaps}:
they're conditioned by identifiable linguistic factors (verb, register, length)
in consistent ways. Second, they're [learnable]{.smallcaps}: the conditioning
factors are available in the input, and speakers converge on similar
probabilities through exposure. Third, they're [predictive]{.smallcaps}: a model
trained on one dataset generalizes to held-out data, showing that the patterns
capture something stable rather than fitting noise.

What makes this "grammatical" rather than "pragmatic" or "stylistic"? The
boundaries aren't sharp, but the key point is stability. If the same factors
condition the same choices across speakers and registers, we're dealing with
shared linguistic knowledge, not individual preference or contextual
accommodation. Usage-based approaches to grammar have long emphasized that
probabilistic patterns can be grammaticalized -- internalized as part of the
language system rather than computed on the fly [@Tagliamonte2006; @BresnanFord2010; @Goldberg2006].

The theoretical stake is whether grammar is fundamentally categorical (all-or-
nothing rules) or fundamentally gradient (degrees and probabilities). I'm not
claiming that categorical rules don't exist. But I am claiming that alternation
probabilities belong to the same explanatory domain as agreement patterns or
word order rules. They're facts about English that native speakers know [@Bresnan2007].

## A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Modeling

Many linguists are unfamiliar with Bayesian statistics. This section explains
the approach in plain language, emphasizing what it offers for linguistic
questions. Technical details appear in the Appendix. For broad introductions tailored to social science, see @McElreath2020 and @GelmanHill2007.

### Why Bayesian?

Quantitative linguistic research has typically relied on significance tests. You fit a model, get a *p*-value, and conclude that the effect is "significant" or not. While useful, this approach has three key limitations. First, *p*-values don't tell us what we usually want to know: "How strong is the effect?" or "How certain are we?" Second, traditional methods often treat items (like verbs) in isolation, struggling with sparse data. Third, they ignore prior knowledge: we know that effects implying absolute certainty (e.g., 100 log-odds) are implausible, but frequentist methods can't easily encode this.

Bayesian modeling offers a solution. Instead of a single "significant/non-significant" decision, it yields a [distribution]{.smallcaps} of plausible values, directly quantifying uncertainty. It lets us encode principled prior knowledge (e.g., that effects are likely small) to regularize estimates.

It also solves the "rare verb" problem. Common verbs like *think* provide ample data, but rare verbs like *allege* appear only a few times. A naive model estimates rare verbs unreliably. Bayesian multilevel models use [partial pooling]{.smallcaps} to share information: they assume verbs come from a common population and "shrink" extreme estimates for rare verbs toward the overall mean. This mirrors the intuition that rare verbs probably behave like the rest of the lexicon unless we have strong evidence otherwise.

### Understanding the Output

To interpret the model's output, two concepts are helpful.

First, effects are reported in [log-odds]{.smallcaps} (logits), the standard scale for logistic regression.
- **0** corresponds to 50% probability.
- **+2.2** corresponds to ~90% probability (strong preference for *that*).
- **−2.2** corresponds to ~10% probability (strong preference for bare).
A coefficient of **+0.5** represents a moderate shift (e.g., from 50% to 62%).

Second, we validate the model using [posterior predictive checks]{.smallcaps}: we use the model to generate fake data and compare it to the real data. If the simulated *that*-rates match the observed ones across registers and verbs, we can trust that the model captures the underlying grammatical system.

## Data

I use the Open American National Corpus (OANC, GrAF release) [@IdeSuderman2004; @OANC], which includes spoken and written registers. I parse documents with spaCy [@spacy] and identify finite content clauses via the Universal Dependencies [ccomp]{.smallcaps} relation [@NivreEtAl2016UD; @ZemanEtAl2020UDv2]. For each clause, I record whether the subordinator *that* is present (via the [mark]{.smallcaps} relation with lemma *that*).

This extraction yields 302,522 tokens distributed across three register groups:

- Spoken: 136,283 tokens (10.4% *that*)
- Written (journalism): 106,146 tokens (31.4% *that*)
- Written (academic): 60,093 tokens (41.2% *that*)

The overall *that*-rate is 23.9%, but this masks substantial variation by
register and by matrix verb. The extraction is deliberately narrow: I focus on
[ccomp]{.smallcaps} clauses and exclude relative clauses, fused relatives, and
other edge cases. This keeps the analysis clean at the cost of coverage.

## Model

I fit a Bayesian logistic regression predicting *that*-realization from clause length (subtree size in tokens), head-clause distance (tokens between the matrix verb and the clause head), and extraposition status. The model has a multilevel structure that reflects the nested nature of the data:

- **Verb-level random intercepts**: Each verb gets its own baseline *that*-rate, drawn from a shared population. This captures lexical specificity (e.g., *think* preferring bare, *prove* preferring *that*) while allowing partial pooling across verbs.
- **Register-specific intercepts**: Spoken, journalism, and academic registers have distinct baselines, capturing the large observed differences in *that*-rate.
- **Register-varying slopes for length and distance**: The effect of clause length on *that* may differ between spoken and written registers (e.g., complexity might matter more when planning time is limited). Rather than assuming a single global slope, the model estimates separate slopes for each register.
- **A fixed effect for extraposition**: Extraposed clauses tend to favour overt *that*, so this binary indicator captures that tendency.

The priors are weakly informative: they encode the broad expectation that effects are likely modest (not implying near-certainty) but allow the data to dominate. For instance, the prior on log-odds coefficients is $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, meaning effects larger than ~2 (which would shift probability from 50% to 88%) are treated as unlikely but not impossible. This regularization helps prevent overfitting, especially for rare verbs.

In linguistic terms, the model asks: when you control for verb identity and register, do longer clauses favour *that*? Do more distant or extraposed clauses favour *that*? And how much variation exists among verbs beyond what register and processing factors explain?

## Results

### Lexical Conditioning is Strong

Different verbs have dramatically different *that*-rates. Among the frequent
verbs, *think* shows a bare-clause rate above 90%, while *prove* shows a
*that*-rate above 80%. The model captures this heterogeneity through the parameter $\sigma_{\text{lemma}}$, which measures the standard deviation of verb intercepts. This value is estimated at approximately 1.77 on the log-odds scale, a large value indicating substantial lexical specificity. To put this in perspective: a shift of two standard deviations in verb identity (e.g., moving from an average verb to a strongly *that*-preferring one) changes the predicted probability more than the entire effect of register.

Partial pooling matters most for rare verbs. A verb with only 15 tokens and an
observed *that*-rate of 100% gets shrunk toward the population mean, reflecting
the fact that 15/15 is probably sample noise rather than a true categorical
preference.

### Register Matters

Register effects are large and consistent. Spoken registers have baseline
*that*-rates around 10%, while written academic prose runs above 40%. This
threefold difference persists after controlling for verb identity: it isn't just
that spoken corpora happen to include more *think* and fewer *prove*.

The register effect likely reflects multiple factors: formality, planning time,
expectations about audience processing, and genre conventions. Disentangling
these requires additional data.

![*That*-rate by register (top 12 by N)](results/figures/that_rate_by_register.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

### Processing Effects are Modest But Consistent

Longer clauses favour *that*. The coefficient for clause length ($\beta_{\text{len}}$) estimates the change in log-odds for a one-standard-deviation increase in length. The model finds $\beta_{\text{len}} \approx 0.51$, meaning that as clauses get longer, the probability of *that* increases substantially. This effect is consistent with processing accounts: *that* may function as a cue that a clause boundary is coming, helping listeners parse complex material.
 
 The distance effect is negative ($\beta_{\text{dist}} \approx -0.50$), meaning that greater distance between the matrix verb and the clause slightly disfavours *that*. This is
unexpected and may reflect confounding with clause structure. I leave
interpretation for future work.

Importantly, processing effects are modest relative to lexical effects. Verb
identity matters more than clause length. This suggests that speakers'
internalized verb-specific preferences dominate contextual adjustment.

### Validation

In-sample posterior predictive checks show that the model captures observed
*that*-rates closely -- within percentage points for each register and for
high-frequency verbs.

For out-of-sample validation, I hold out 20% of documents (stratified by
register) and predict their *that*-rates from a model trained on the remaining
80%. The held-out predictions slightly underpredict written registers (observed
33.2% vs. predicted 30.5% for journalism; observed 47.8% vs. predicted 45.4% for
academic), while spoken rates are well aligned. This underprediction suggests
missing predictors -- perhaps discourse factors like givenness or information
structure -- but the overall fit is strong.

## Discussion

### Alternation Probabilities are Grammatical Knowledge

The patterns reported here support the claim that alternation probabilities are
part of grammatical competence. The effects are systematic (conditioned by
identifiable factors), learnable (the factors are present in the input), and
predictive (the model generalizes to held-out data).

This doesn't mean traditional categorical grammar is wrong. Many aspects of
English are all-or-nothing: *she left* is grammatical, *she leaved* isn't. But
alternation phenomena like subordinator realization occupy a different part of
the grammatical landscape -- a part where probabilities, not just possibilities,
define what native speakers know.

### Implications for Grammatical Theory

If alternation probabilities are grammatical, then grammar isn't purely
categorical. Usage-based and constructionist approaches have emphasized this for
decades, but the present analysis provides rigorous evidence: a quantitative
model that captures the phenomenon and validates out of sample.

The lexical specificity is striking. The difference between *think* and *prove*
isn't a difference in meaning or argument structure that would predict their
*that*-preferences. It appears to be a difference in learned usage patterns --
what Goldberg calls "surface generalizations" and what construction grammar
emphasizes as item-specific knowledge.

### Implications for Methodology

The analysis demonstrates the value of Bayesian multilevel modeling for
linguistic questions. Partial pooling handles lexical heterogeneity gracefully,
letting common verbs speak for themselves while regularizing rare verbs.
Posterior distributions answer the questions linguists actually care about ("How
different are spoken and written?"), and posterior predictive checks focus
attention on whether the model captures the phenomenon.

This doesn't mean Bayesian methods are always necessary. For simple between-group
comparisons with ample data, traditional approaches work fine. But for complex,
hierarchical, sparse data -- the norm in corpus linguistics -- Bayesian
multilevel models offer substantial advantages.

### Limitations and Future Work

The present analysis has several limitations. First, the extraction is narrow:
only [ccomp]{.smallcaps} clauses are included. Extending to clausal subjects,
extraposed clauses, and clauses with other matrix categories (adjectives, nouns)
remains for future work.

Second, I don't yet include surprisal as a predictor. The uniform information
density hypothesis predicts that subordinator insertion should increase when the
clause onset is unpredictable. Adding surprisal would test this prediction
directly.

Third, discourse factors are absent. The distinction between given and new
information, the position in the sentence, and the communicative context may all
condition *that*-realization. Incorporating these requires richer annotation.

Finally, the analysis covers only American English. Cross-variety comparison
would reveal whether the conditioning factors are stable or whether they differ
by region or register.

## Conclusion

This paper has argued that the choice between *that*-content clauses and bare
content clauses isn't random variation or performance noise. It's grammatical
knowledge: systematic patterns learned from usage and conditioned by verb,
register, and processing factors.

The analysis demonstrates two things. First, alternation probabilities belong to
the same explanatory domain as categorical grammatical rules. They're facts about
English that speakers know. Second, Bayesian multilevel modeling is well suited
to capturing these probabilities, handling lexical heterogeneity and validating
against held-out data.

Future work will extend this approach to other alternations -- the dative, the
genitive, particle placement -- testing whether the same conditioning factors
predict parallel patterns. If they do, we'll have evidence that alternations as
a class reflect shared grammatical mechanisms.

### Model Specification

The model is a Bayesian logistic regression:

$$
\text{logit}(P(y_i = 1)) = \alpha + \alpha_{\text{reg}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{lemma}[i]} + (\beta_{\text{len}} + b_{\text{len,reg}[i]}) \cdot \text{len}_i + (\beta_{\text{dist}} + b_{\text{dist,reg}[i]}) \cdot \text{dist}_i
$$

Where:

- $\alpha$ is the overall intercept
- $\alpha_{\text{reg}[i]}$ is the register-specific intercept
- $\alpha_{\text{lemma}[i]}$ is the verb-level random intercept
- $\beta_{\text{len}}, \beta_{\text{dist}}$ are the population-level slopes
- $b_{\text{len,reg}[i]}, b_{\text{dist,reg}[i]}$ are register-varying slopes

### Priors

- Fixed intercepts: Normal(0, 1.5)
- Fixed slopes: Normal(0, 1)
- Random intercept SD: Half-Normal(0, 1)
- Random slope SDs: Half-Normal(0, 1)

### Diagnostics

The model was fit using CmdStanR with 4 chains of 2000 iterations each (1000
warmup). Divergent transitions: 2/1000 at adapt_delta = 0.95. All R-hat values
< 1.01. Effective sample sizes > 400 for all parameters.
